					I've created my implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Well, there's life on my blog now :-) <br />

					Let's be honest: this is not my first attempt at writing a blog.
					I like <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">words</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					I like to spend time reading blogs and exploring <i>personal</i> home pages.
					Of course, I'm talking about sites with stories, helpful articles, or just interesting stuff.
					Typical websites that promote a "personal brand"; sites full of trackers or ads; sites that don't
					work without javascript for no reason â€“ they all suck.
				</p>

				<p>
					A site with homemade recipes? Interesting! A blog of a developer who creates compilers? Definitely interesting!
					A site about bears? A website with a digitized collection of film photos from the 20th century that were found on eBay?
					The blog of a man who decided to visit every country in the world? A collection of gifs that were popular in 2003?
					Reviews of old hardware from the early 2000s, written by a guy from Sweden? I'd love to read it!
					That's what the internet was created for.
				</p>

				<p>
					I wish there were more websites on the Internet like above. I hope this will be one of them.
					Wish me luck with this.
