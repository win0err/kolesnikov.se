					If you're reading this page, that means you want to know a little more about me.
					Thank you for your interest!
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm Sergei Kolesnikov (a.k.a. win0err): software engineer, photographer, and professional procrastinator.
					I write computer programs and create websites. Sometimes I contribute to open source projects.
				</p>

				<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

				<p>
					I usually write code in JavaScript and Go, but I also use Python&nbsp;3, C (not C++), PHP, and more.
					Most of my projects can be found on GitHub (like <a href="https://github.com/win0err/gnome-runcat">RunCat for GNOME Shell</a>, <a href="https://github.com/win0err/aphrodite-terminal-theme">Aphrodite Terminal Theme</a>, etc.).
				</p>

				<h3>Software Development</h3>

				<p>I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://any-cut.pro/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">AnyCut</a>.</p>

				<h3>Academy</h3>

				<p>
					I did my bachelor's and master's degrees in System & Software Engineering at the MIREA — ­Russian Technological University.
					Furthermore, I am a PhD student at the same university.
				</p>

				<p>My research interests are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>software engineering (concepts, languages, methods, architectures, tools),</li>
					<li>user interfaces (human-computer interaction, user interfaces for software development),</li>
					<li>computer networks (web, distributed systems).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					I worked as a teaching assistant for MIREA — ­Russian Technological University, Department of Software and Standardization of Information Technologies (Courses: Object-Oriented Programming in Java, Software Development Technologies).
				</p>

				<!--
					<h3>Other activities</h3>
					<p>Msk Vue.js Meetup-2019 (Moscow, Russia), Functional Programming with Vue.js and Vuex. Strengths and most effective application points.</p>
				-->

				<h3>Software & Hardware I use</h3>

				<p>
					I use two laptops for my work.
					The first one is a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 10 (Intel Core i7-1280P, 32 GB RAM, 2 TB SSD) with Fedora Linux installed, which replaced my 10-year-old HP Envy 15-j002er (Intel Core i7-4700MQ, 12 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD).
					The second one is a MacBook Pro 15" 2018 (Intel Core i7-8850H, 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD).
				</p>

				<p>
					My monitor is 29" LG UltraWide 29WP60G-B, which is connected to both laptops. I really recommend you to try ultra-wide monitors!
				</p>

				<p>
					I also have a couple of Raspberry Pis around the house and a custom NAS server with Ubuntu Server installed.
				</p>

				<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>

				<p>
					I like to travel around the world. Someday I'll add a map with the places I've visited.
					Furthermore, I shoot portraits and landscapes.
					<!-- Nikon is the best cameras in the world, I have at least six cameras from this manufacturer. -->
